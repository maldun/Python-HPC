How to use Python
=========================================

The "Goodbye World" program.
-----------------------------------------
In the old tradition of the "<insert Language here> for Dummies" books, I used in my very early years,
we start with the "Goodbye World" program.

#. Make a file goodbye_world.py (or what name you like).
#. Open your Editor.
#. Write::
    
    print("Goodbye World!")

#. Execute::

    python goodbye_world.py

   and you get the output::

    Goodbye World!

Thats all!

**Remark:** If you use Sage as your Python interpreter, simply start the program with ::
    
    sage goodbye_world.py

or ::

    sage -python goodbye_world.py
