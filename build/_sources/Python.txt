About Python
==============================

What is Python
-----------------------------
Python is a high level interpreted object oriented (OO) language.
It's main field of application is in web design and scripting. 

In the last five years there was a huge development of mathematical tools
and libraries for Python. Actually it seems that there is no particular reason for 
this one could see it as a phenomen, or as a trend. But in the meantime the currently
available Python projects reached now dimension that make them vaiable alternatives 
for the "classical" mathematical languages like Matlab or MAthematica.

Also there are now some very useful tools for code optimization available like *Cython*,
that makes it possible to compile your Python Code to *C* and make it up to 1000x faster,
than normal Python code. 

A brief History
-----------------------------

Get Python
------------------------------
The programs and packages used here are all open source, so they can be obtained freely.
Most Linux distributions already ship Python, because many scripts are written in Python.
See also the *Python* project page for further information [#]_ . 
An easy way to obtain Python is to install *Sagemath* [#]_, which contains many useful packages extensions
and packages for mathematics.
Another possibility would be *FEMhub* which is a fork of *Sage* [#]_ . FEMhub is smaller, but more experimental than
Sage, and is aimed only for numerics. 
Some of the packages I introduce here are are currently outdated in Sage/FEMhub or not available yet. Current Versions are
available on my Google code project page [#]_.
The drawback of these distributions is that they are not available as .deb or .rpm packages. They have to be build
from source, and currently only work on Linux and
